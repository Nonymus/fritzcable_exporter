Fritzcable exporter
===================

# What
[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) exporter for Fritzbox Cable downstream channel error counters

# Why
Mine ends up in a 100% package loss state sometimes, but without detecting a problem by itself, or reconnecting on it's
own. Error counters seem high when I take a look in the UI, but I'd like a history to see if it's really related, or 
just coincidence, because I don't look at the counters in the UI if everything is fine.

There are loads more FritzBox Exporters on GitHub.

I needed one that exports Docsis channel statistics, which none of the TR-064 exporters can expose, because AVM
didn't put them in TR-064 in the first place for whatever reason.

And then I didn't look too hard for an exporter using the UI endpoints because I wanted to play around with Go again a 
bit.
